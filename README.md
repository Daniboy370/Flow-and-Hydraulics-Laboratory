# Flow-and-Hydraulics-Laboratory
Matlab codes I wrote as part of Prof. [Uri Shavit](https://cee.technion.ac.il/members/uri-shavit/)'s research team :


"Our research group studies transport phenomena in complex, mostly porous, environments. The laboratory, 
field, and theoretical studies include applications of volume averaging theories, the development of mean
flow models, an analysis of solute and particle dispersion, and topics in soil physics, hydrology and 
biogeochemical processes in streambeds and soils. We use PIV and PLIF in the lab and in the field 
including a new underwater PIV system for coral reef flow research."
